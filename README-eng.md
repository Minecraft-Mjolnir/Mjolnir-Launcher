Mjolnir Launcher is a Minecraft launcher with anti-cheat plugin

Function: Anti-Cheat System AntiCheatHammer

## Supported Platforms

Windows (supported), Macos (not supported), Linux (not supported)

## Do I need to pay any fees?

Our Mjolnir Launcher is FREE!!! FREE!!! FREE!!! (Important to say it three times!)

As long as your Microsoft account has a genuine Minecraft license.

## How the launcher works

The operating principle is similar to the original launcher

But it's worth mentioning that Mjolnir Launcher is a very simple, clean launcher game that doesn't drag on.

Currently tested: Can't install 3rd party builds, Forge or Fabric (and we don't want it either, you might break the glass(umm nah glass is rules :P) when you play addon servers and install something)

Every time you need to log in to your Microsoft account to prevent you from forgetting your password and account security! (Latest: We support you to remember your account password for 1 day period)

Tips: This launcher does not support Mojang accounts (Mjolnir team recommends that you upgrade (migrate) to a Microsoft account to protect your account security from being stolen by the blasting team and Lupin III)

## Launcher usage object

Servers using AntiCheatHammer (whether or not to force Mjolnir Launcher to log in depends on the server owner)

and

All genuine Minecraft players (if you insist on using our launcher we are happy and thank you for your trust!)

## Launcher final target

Do not use plug-in (assist, cheat) versions, mods and third-party game versions when logging into multiplayer servers. Only play with the vanilla game version (NOTE! This description is pending...)

If you get banned after trying multiple times...then you may want to say sorry to the server owner and explain to our team what to unblock you.

## Why can't the launcher record the account password for quick login?

At present, we only support you to remember the account password for 1 day. The reason is very simple to prevent your account from being exposed on the computer hard disk, or if you want us to remember the account password and it can be blasted directly by the blasting team :).

While this will take a while, it's a lot better than less secure.

## Why is Mojang account login not supported?

When the Mjolnir team studied the login of the Mojang account, they found that the account is more dangerous at the login stage than the Microsoft account login (it is recommended that old players who have not transferred to Microsoft should transfer quickly to avoid being stolen by Lupin III)

## Which languages will Mjolnir Launcher support?

Currently, only two major languages are supported: English and Chinese (traditional)

For the traditional Chinese part, the team will not make a traditional Chinese version until the English version has obtained a completeness! Please forgive me.
